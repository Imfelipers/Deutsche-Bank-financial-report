**Financial Performance Analysis of Deutsche Bank (2015-2017)**

The analyzed graphs show a consistent behavior among several of the bank’s main financial metrics during the period from 2015 to 2017.

Firstly, we observe that the total dividends paid have remained below the total net income throughout the period. However, both metrics follow a similar trend, indicating that the dividends have been aligned, though slightly lower, with the net income generated. This suggests that while the bank has been distributing a portion of its earnings, it has maintained a more conservative payout ratio, which could reflect a policy of profit retention aimed at strengthening its balance sheet.

On the other hand, when comparing operating income and net income, it is noteworthy that in 2017, net income was lower, while in 2016 it reached a peak, indicating an exceptional performance that year, followed by a slight decline in 2017. This could reflect a slowdown or economic factors that affected net earnings during that period.

Regarding net income, it was consistently reported at 193.5 billion monetary units over the three years (2015-2017), which indicates stability in the income generated by the bank, although the decline in 2017 could have impacted other key indicators.

The total tax expenses from 2015 to 2017 amounted to 54.9 billion, which represents a significant portion of net income. This behavior also aligns with the downward trend observed in the bank's equity, suggesting that tax payments were not the only factor impacting the decrease in the bank’s equity position.

Equity has shown a declining trend during this period, which could indicate that the bank has faced challenges in generating returns to offset the effects of tax payments or other financial decisions. This, along with the decrease in tax payments, may reflect an effort to reduce the tax burden while managing the decline in capital.

In summary, while the bank has maintained a stable dividend distribution policy and has managed its net income cautiously, the declines in 2017, both in income and equity, suggest that external factors may have influenced its performance.
